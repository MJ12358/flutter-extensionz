# Flutter Extensionz

A set of [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) extensions I use in various projects.

## Getting started

Add this to your `pubspec.yaml` under `dependencies`

```yaml
flutter_extensionz: ^1.0.3
```

## Usage

```dart
import 'package:flutter_extensionz/flutter_extensionz.dart';

context.showSnackBar(Text('The snack bar text'));
```
